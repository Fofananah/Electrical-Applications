Electrical Applications is a project that I began at the end of 2025. I started this project due to a promise I made to myself 2 years prior, this promise was that I should be fully capable of verbalizing what it is that I want to do for the rest of my life on my 25th birthday of April 19th, 2026. 
As a human being I am a firm believer that if you set a goal, you cannot hope to reach the full potential of that goal, unless you start before the timer even begins to run, so this project will be my dedication to learning the physical and logical aspects of energy and photovoltaic systems in nature.
I have always had a gravitational pull towards the mathematical structure of nature and the technological advancement of human enginuity; although most people consider these two things opposing forces in the grand scheme of things, I hope to find a niche where they are in symbiosis.
